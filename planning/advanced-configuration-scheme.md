# Hierarchical, Event-Driven Configuration and Validation System

## Overview

This concept outlines a configuration architecture for complex software systems. It introduces **hierarchical symbolic keys**, **lifecycle-based validation events**, and **declarative validation policies** to enable scalable, introspectable, and context-sensitive configuration handling.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. **Hierarchical Configuration Keys**

* Configuration is structured as a tree (e.g., `Settings.output.csv.column_width`).
* Symbolic constants (e.g., `const sCOL_WIDTH = Settings.output.csv.column_width`) are used in code for key access.
* Avoids string-based lookups and supports introspection.
* Enables partial tree traversal and whole-path access:

  * `walk("output.csv")` – iterate settings under a branch.
  * `get(sCOL_WIDTH)` – access specific setting directly.

### 2. **Event-Based Validation Lifecycle**

* Validation is triggered by events, organized hierarchically:

  * `construct`
  * `initialize`
  * `invoke_operation`

    * `invoke_operation/convert_table_to_csv`
    * `invoke_operation/format_table_with_box_drawing`
* Each setting declares:

  * **When** it should be validated (event or subtree of events).
  * **How** it should be validated (type check, range, dependencies).

### 3. **Contextual Validation**

* Settings may be:

  * Required for some operations but not others.
  * Validated differently depending on event context.
* Enables:

  * Reuse of partially valid configuration structures.
  * Incremental configuration and deferred validation.
  * Explicit finalization phase (`finalize`) if needed.

### 4. **Symbolic Addressing and Compatibility**

* Internally use symbols or stable string constants for keys.
* Public APIs may still use strings for interoperability.
* Supports mappings to/from structured formats (JSON, etc.).
* Internal constants remain private, enforcing encapsulation.

---

## Benefits

* **Performance**: Constant-time key access.
* **Maintainability**: Clear organization, avoids hardcoded strings.
* **Tooling Support**: Compatible with auto-documentation, validation UIs.
* **Modularity**: Validation logic is declarative and decoupled from functional logic.
* **Flexibility**: Late binding of configuration; design-time control over validation stage.

---

## Practical Implementation Notes

* Centralize setting key definitions under a structured object (`Settings`).
* Use private symbolic constants for key access in modules.
* Allow configuration to be constructed incrementally.
* Only perform relevant validations at declared stages.
* Provide introspection mechanisms for both configuration and validation metadata.

---

## Deferral Strategy

This system introduces architectural complexity. If not immediately needed in the current project, defer implementation and focus on minimal configuration without lifecycle validation. Design interfaces to allow later introduction of this system without breaking changes.
