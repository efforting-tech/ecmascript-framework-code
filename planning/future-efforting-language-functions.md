# Local Interfaces and Argument Matching in a Custom Language

This document outlines a conceptual design for argument matching and interface declarations in a custom programming language. It introduces local interfaces, matchers, and expressive function parameter declarations for flexible, type-directed, and reusable code patterns.

---

## 1. Local Interface Views

### Concept

A function may bind one of its arguments to a *local interface* that defines how that argument is accessed within the function body. This allows the function to interpret objects through a scoped projection (e.g., using symbol-based keys internally).

### Example

```plaintext
function some_function(resolver using MyInterface) {
    resolver.some_method(); // May translate internally to resolver[SYMBOL.my_method]
}
````

This allows structured, symbolic access without namespace collision or mutation of the original object.

---

## 2. Matcher-Based Argument Binding

### Concept

Functions declare what kinds of arguments they accept using *matchers*—named sets of typed or structural patterns. These matchers can be composed, reused, and refined.

### Syntax Example

```plaintext
matcher Displayable = (
    Screen instance as screen,
    Printer instance as printer
)

function render(using Displayable) {
    screen.draw();
    printer.print();
}
```

The `using` clause introduces local bindings for matched arguments.

---

## 3. Modifiers and Matching Rules

### Optional and Required

```plaintext
matcher Screen_op = (
    required Screen instance as screen,
    optional ScreenSettings instance as extra_settings
)
```

* `required`: The argument must be present and match the given type.
* `optional`: If present, the argument must match; otherwise, it's omitted or set to a default.

### Default Values

```plaintext
optional Logger instance as logger = NullLogger
```

### Repeated Matching

```plaintext
repeated DataPoint instance as points
```

Binds all matching arguments into a collection `points`.

### Exclusive

```plaintext
exclusive (TextOutput | BinaryOutput) instance as output
```

Fails if multiple of the exclusive group are matched.

---

## 4. Matcher Composition and Refinement

### Exclusion

```plaintext
matcher AdjustableFurniture = (
    all of Furniture except Chair
)
```

### Intersection

```plaintext
matcher ClickableAndDrawable = (
    all of Clickable ∩ Drawable
)
```

### Union

```plaintext
matcher IODevice = (
    all of Printer ∪ Scanner
)
```

---

## 5. Invocation Semantics

Arguments can be matched by type or structural identity, and can appear in any order. Matching is deterministic and declarative, based on the defined matcher.

Call sites do not need to specify matcher names explicitly:

```plaintext
do_render(myScreen, myPrinter, otherStuff)
```

The function implementation determines what to bind and ignore based on the matcher definition.

---

## 6. Benefits

* **Modular Reuse**: Common patterns extracted to matchers
* **Clarity**: Declarations document argument expectations
* **Flexibility**: Order and presence of arguments decoupled from function signature
* **Safety**: Matching logic ensures correctness and completeness
* **Tooling Support**: Matchers can be inspected, documented, or statically verified

---

## 7. Related Concepts

* Typeclasses and instance resolution (Haskell)
* Structural matching and extension methods (Rust, Scala, Kotlin)
* Pattern matching in function arguments (ML-family, Elixir)
* Capability-based argument passing (secure object systems)

---

This matcher system is designed to work synergistically with symbolic configuration keys, staged validation events, and introspection mechanisms in a broader language runtime.
